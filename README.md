# **SecurePay: Detecting Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions in Real-Time**

**Project Description:**

With the rise of online payments, credit cards have become one of the most widely used tools for financial transactions, making fraud detection increasingly essential. Unauthorized credit card use not only results in financial losses for both consumers and institutions but also undermines customer confidence in secure online payments. Therefore, developing an effective system to identify and mitigate fraud in real-time is critical.

**Objective:**
The goal of **SecurePay** is to build an advanced classification model that accurately detects fraudulent credit card transactions as they occur. By analyzing transaction patterns, SecurePay aims to safeguard customers and prevent unauthorized charges by providing financial institutions with an automated, real-time fraud detection solution.

**Dataset Overview:**
The dataset used in this project includes credit card transactions made by European cardholders over two days in September 2013. It contains a total of 284,807 transactions, with only 492 identified as fraudulent, representing just 0.172% of all transactions. This severe class imbalance poses a challenge, as SecurePay must effectively identify rare fraudulent cases without compromising the accuracy of legitimate transactions.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning data, addressing any missing values, and normalizing features to enhance consistency.
   - Implementing techniques to handle class imbalance, such as resampling and tailored algorithms for imbalanced data.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Extracting and selecting key features to improve model performance while reducing computation time.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Testing a range of classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, LightGBM) and assessing their performance on fraud detection.
   - Utilizing ensemble methods to achieve optimal predictive accuracy and robustness.

4. **Evaluation and Optimization**:
   - Focusing on critical metrics such as AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, especially emphasizing fraud detection sensitivity.
   - Conducting hyperparameter tuning to optimize model accuracy and reduce false positives.

5. **Validation**:
   - Cross-validating the model to ensure reliability and prevent overfitting.

6. **Deployment for Real-Time Detection**:
   - Configuring the model for real-time deployment, allowing it to evaluate transactions instantly and flag suspicious activity.

**Outcome:**
The SecurePay model will enable financial institutions to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time, helping to reduce financial losses and foster customer trust. With an emphasis on accuracy and efficiency, SecurePay is designed to be a vital tool in the fight against credit card fraud.
